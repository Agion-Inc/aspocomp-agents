  - Created frontend with black & white theme
  - Implemented HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality
  - Added message rendering, function call indicators, and error handling
  - All 47 backend tests passing
  - Complete web UI ready for testing

- 2025-01-XX: TDD Implementation Plan for Web UI
  - Created comprehensive TDD-driven task list for iterative implementation
  - Documented in `docs/tdd_implementation_plan.md`
  - Plan includes 8 phases: Backend foundation, API endpoints, Frontend foundation, API client, UI components, Function calls, Integration, E2E testing
  - Each task follows TDD cycle: Red (write test) → Green (implement) → Refactor
  - Includes test specifications, implementation tasks, and validation steps
  - Updated `docs/todo.md` with TDD-based task breakdown

- 2025-01-XX: Web UI Design Documentation
  - Created comprehensive design documentation for web chat interface
  - Documented frontend architecture (HTML/CSS/JS) in `docs/frontend.md`
  - Documented backend architecture (Flask API) in `docs/backend.md`
  - Documented system architecture and integration in `docs/architecture.md`
  - Created subsystem documentation in `docs/subsystems/web_chat.md`
  - Added web UI development tasks to `docs/todo.md`
  - Design includes modern chat UI with black & white theme, function call indicators, responsive design
  - Backend integrates with existing `gemini_agent.py` module
  - No implementation yet - documentation only per user request

- 2025-08-29: Tools maintenance
  - Added tools/utils/download.ts for Replicate video tool
  - Fixed tools/gemini.ts to accept GEMINI_API_KEY fallback
  - Updated tools/gemini-image-tool.js to default to Imagen 3, redacted API key in logs
  - Updated tools/gemini-image wrapper to run Node script
  - Improved duration validation and output handling in tools/generate-video.ts
  - Validated: download-file, remove-background-advanced, gemini.ts, gemini-image-tool, gemini-image wrapper
  - Skipped video generation per request
- **NEW: Intelligent System Prompt** - dramatically improved task planning and function calling performance
  - Comprehensive system prompt that teaches the model to be proactive with function calling
  - Automatic task analysis and multi-step workflow planning
  - Clear guidance on when and how to use each of the 12 available CLI functions
  - Examples of excellent behavior patterns for complex multi-step tasks
  - Model now automatically calls appropriate functions without explicit user instruction
  - Tested with complex workflows: search + image generation, multi-function sequences work perfectly
  - Integrated into both single-turn and interactive chat modes
- **ENHANCED: Image Generation File Path Returns** - improved workflow for image editing
  - Modified nano-banana tool to clearly output file paths in structured format
  - Updated system prompt to extract and present file paths prominently to users
  - Users now get clear file paths like `public/images/image-name.png` after image generation
  - Enables seamless workflow: generate image → get path → edit image using that path
  - Works in both single-turn and interactive chat modes
- **NEW TOOL: DateTime CLI** - comprehensive date and time utilities
  - Created datetime tool with support for multiple formats (ISO, date, time, full, short, compact)
  - Timezone support for global time queries (e.g., "What time is it in Tokyo?")
  - UTC and Unix timestamp options for technical use cases
  - Locale support for international formatting (en-US, fi-FI, sv-SE, etc.)
  - Integrated into gemini_agent.py as 13th available CLI function
  - Added to package.json scripts and README.md documentation
- **NEW TOOL: Data Indexing CLI** - comprehensive web content and file indexing
  - Created data-indexing tool using Gemini for both content chunking and embeddings generation
  - Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash for intelligent content processing and structure extraction
  - Uses gemini-embedding-001 for high-quality 3072-dimensional embeddings
  - Supports both web URLs and local files for content input
  - Stores processed chunks in ChromaDB with rich metadata (topics, keywords, tables, images)
  - Creates separate collections to avoid dimension conflicts with existing Ollama-based data
  - Integrated as 14th CLI function in gemini_agent.py
  - Enables powerful RAG workflows: index content → query semantically → get relevant chunks
- **NEW TOOL: Semantic Search CLI** - intelligent content retrieval from ChromaDB
  - Created semantic-search tool using Gemini embeddings for vector similarity search
  - Uses same gemini-embedding-001 model as indexing for consistent embedding space
  - Supports advanced filtering: collection selection, result count, distance thresholds, metadata filters
  - Rich output formatting with topics, keywords, content previews, and source information
  - Integrated as 15th CLI function in gemini_agent.py
  - Completes the RAG pipeline: data-indexing → semantic-search → intelligent retrieval
  - Tested complete workflow: index Python info → search "who created Python" → retrieve "Guido van Rossum"
  - **ROBUST ERROR HANDLING**: Added timeout protections and fallback chunking for large/complex content
  - Successfully tested with real-world website (Kipinä Software) including Finnish content
  - Handles content size limits, API timeouts, and Gemini processing failures gracefully
