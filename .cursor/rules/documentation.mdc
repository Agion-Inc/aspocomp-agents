  ## Subfolders under the docs folder to update software subsystem decomposition and sw design patterns
    - patterns: folder that contains software pattern for implementing certain kind of parts in the system. Use these always to get up to date information about how to implement features.
    - subsystems: folder that contains subsystem descriptions and links to the files belonging to a subsystem. Use these to document and understand about the details of single subsystems and to evaluate the relations between the componenents.
    - agents: folder that contains documentation for each AI agent in the system. Each agent should have its own documentation file describing its purpose, capabilities, integration points, and configuration. Use these to understand agent-specific functionality and how agents connect to the main web chat system. 

  ## important files at root folder   
    - `package.json`: List of used npm packages and versions.
    - `README.md`: **Comprehensive setup guide**, tool descriptions, usage examples, and API key instructions
    - `.env.example`: Template for required environment variables and API keys

  **Link Handling:**
    - Documents might contain links to certain document in external repos. Read them separately when needed.
    - For `http://` or `https://` links: Use web search to get information from the URL if needed for the task (e.g., documentation, error context).
